# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis 
In this project, we are helping a a ride sharing App company, PyBer, analyze all the rideshare data from January to May 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO . Using Python and Pandas, we will create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we will create some graphs that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. We will conclude by writing a report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by the CEO at PyBer.
## Results
According to our analysis for the total ries for each city type:
  - Urban: shows the highest number of ride as 1625
  - Suburban : total rides was 625
  - Rural: total rides was 125.
For the total drivers per city type, we pulled this data:
  - Urban: had more drivers in total as 2405
  - Suburban : total total drivers was 498
  - Rural: finally, we has 78 in total.
When we take the average fare per ride, we realize that that Rural had 34.62, followed by Suburban with 30.97 then Urban with 24.53.(Please see images attached)
Pyber total fares was as followed:
  - Urban: 39,854.38
  - Suburban: 19,356.33
  - Rural: 4,327.93
On the weekly ride fare, we calculated the weelky total fares per city type dans per date using the sum() method. We noticed that the total weelky ride fares for Urban were higher than the 2 other city type.(Please see images attached) 
## Summary
From our graph, we shows that the Urban line graph is is permanently fluctuating but stable except the mid Mars- April where the fare dramatically dropped and start going up. The Suburban was way lower than the Urban. Finally the Rural is the city type which is not moving at all and where will the company will need to worked on to bring the total fares highger. 
### Provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
1- We would recommand the CEO to send a few drivers from Urban to the Rural. Because of the small number of drivers in Rural, we have noticed that Rural had a very small fare amount. which would not be prodcutive for the company.
2- One of the reason why the company is not get hat much client in Rural an Suburban, could be because of the high average fare per ride which seems to be very high(as shown in the image below). The company would need the reduce that average fare per ride and give a change to many prospect to use their services.
3- Finally, the company will need to increase the average fare per drivers in Urban to have a little disparity amoung all driver regardless the city type. Urban drivers average fare seems to be very low compare to the Rural and Suburban.
